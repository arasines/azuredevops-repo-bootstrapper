# Azure DevOps Repositoy Bootstrapper
This program aims to achieve a seamless synchronization process between an Azure DevOps Repository and a local repository. 
By utilizing smart synchronization techniques, it ensures that the most up-to-date code and assets are always mirrored between the two environments.

## Key Features
<ul>
<li>*Automatic Detection*: The program intelligently detects changes in the Azure DevOps Repository and only synchronizes modified or new files, reducing unnecessary data transfer.</li>
<li>*Efficient Data Transfer*: Through optimized algorithms, the program minimizes data transfer times while ensuring the integrity of the transferred files.</li>
<li>*Customizable Sync Settings*: Users have the flexibility to define synchronization intervals, specific branches, and exclusion rules to tailor the synchronization process to their project's needs.</li>
<li>*Error Handling*: The program incorporates robust error-handling mechanisms to manage unexpected scenarios and provide clear error messages to users.</li>
</ul>
